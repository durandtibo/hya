## Contributing

Please check the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## API stability

:warning: While `hya` is in development stage, no API is guaranteed to be stable from one
release to the next.
In fact, it is very likely that the API will change multiple times before a stable 1.0.0 release.
In practice, this means that upgrading `hya` to a new version will possibly break any code that
was using the old version of `hya`.

## License

`hya` is licensed under BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license available in [LICENSE](LICENSE)
file.
