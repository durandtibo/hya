# check_dependency_tree.sh - Validate package dependency tree structure
#
# Description:
#   This script verifies that the hya package has the
#   correct dependency tree structure. It checks that:
#   1. The package is properly installed and recognized
#   2. The only required dependency is hatchling
#   3. The dependency versions match expected patterns
#
# Usage:
#   ./check_dependency_tree.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   - uv must be installed and available in PATH
#   - hya must be installed in the current environment
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - Dependency tree validation passed
#   1 - Dependency tree validation failed (unexpected dependencies or versions)
